TODO {#todo}
============
* Fix zmq::socket_t.send() deprecation warning

* Maybe return std::unique_ptr<WriteHandle> from the ZipCreator. Since the
  ganil changes these objects are dynamically allocated! Will have to change
  the c-layer too!

* Better mvlc factory to create an mvlc based on a connection string

* Core API for reading listfiles and working with the data:
  - Multiple views:
    - linear readout data (does not need crate config)
    - DONE parsed readout data
    - DONE single thread / blocking api for working with event data
* Add (API) version info to CrateConfig and the yaml format.

* abstraction for the trigger/io system. This needs to be flexible because the
  system is going to change with future firmware udpates.

* examples
  - Minimal CrateConfig creation and writing it to file
  - Complete manual readout including CrateConfig setup for an MDPP-16

* Multicrate support (later)
  - Additional information needed and where to store it.
  - multi-crate-mini-daq
  - multi-crate-mini-daq-replay

* mini-daq and mini-daq-replay: load plugins like in mvme/listfile_reader This
  would make the two tools way more useful (and more complex). Specify plugins
  to load (and their args) on the command line.
