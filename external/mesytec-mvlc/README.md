# mesytec-mvlc - driver and utilities for the [mesytec MVLC VME Controller](https://mesytec.com/products/nuclear-physics/MVLC.html)

*mesytec-mvlc* is a driver and utility library for the [Mesytec MVLC VME
controller](https://mesytec.com/products/nuclear-physics/MVLC.html) written in
C++. The library consists of low-level code for accessing MVLCs over USB or
Ethernet and higher-level communication logic for reading and writing internal
MVLC registers and accessing VME modules. Additionally the basic blocks needed
to build high-performance MVLC based DAQ readout systems are provided:

* Configuration holding the setup and readout information for a single VME
  crate containing multiple VME modules.

* Multithreaded readout worker and listfile writer using fast data compression
  (LZ4 or ZIP deflate).

* Readout parser which is able to handle potential ethernet packet loss.

* Live access to readout data on a best effort basis. Sniffing at the data
  stream does not block or slow down the readout.

* Examples showing how to combine the above parts into a working readout system
  and how to replay data from a previously recorded listfile.

* Various counters for monitoring the system.

mesytec-mvlc is used in the [mvme](https://mesytec.com/downloads/mvme.html) DAQ
software to implement MVLC support.
